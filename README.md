# üß† AYPR: Introduction to Algorithms & Programming

Welcome to the repository for **AYPR (Algoritmos y Programaci√≥n)** at the _Escuela Colombiana de Ingenier√≠a Julio Garavito_.  
This course marks the **first approach** to thinking algorithmically and solving problems with structured logic. You‚Äôll find theoretical materials, exercises in Python, and a **final project** focusing on real-world data processing.

## üìö Topics Covered

### ü§î Programming Foundations
- **Logical Reasoning**: Step-by-step thinking for solving problems.
- **Basic Syntax & Concepts**: Variables, data types, operators.
- **Control Structures**: Conditionals, loops, modularity (functions/subprograms).
- **Structured & Procedural Programming**: Code organization and readability best practices.

### üõ†Ô∏è Fundamentals of Python
- **Input/Output**: Reading and writing data.
- **Functions**: Encapsulation, parameters, and return values.
- **Error Handling**: Approaches for debugging and ensuring robust code.
- **Code Optimization & Cleanliness**: Short, clear expressions, meaningful names, and documentation.

### üñ•Ô∏è Course Materials
- Slides, PDFs, and notes providing theoretical context for each module.
- Sample scripts demonstrating fundamental Python concepts.
- Exercises focusing on problem-solving and algorithmic thinking.

## üìÅ What‚Äôs Inside?

- **Theory Folder**:  
  Collection of PDFs, notes, and presentations (e.g., conditionals, modular programming, best practices, etc.).
- **Python Exercises**:  
  Scripts covering various aspects of programming logic, from simple I/O to more advanced data manipulation.
- **Final Project**:  
  A comprehensive program that processes real-like data files to simulate counting votes in regional elections.

## üéØ Final Project: Voting Count System

As the **capstone** for AYPR, students develop a **Python-based** system that reads and processes votes from a text file. This system outputs various statistics to inform the public about voting results by region, city, and country.

### Project Details
**Input Format**: A text file where each line represents a single vote.  
```
Candidato,partido,ciudad,sitio,mesa,genero
```
**Output & Requirements**:
- Show total votes in the entire country.
- Break down votes by city, region, candidate, party, and more.
- Identify winners in different contexts (city-level, overall).
- Determine if a second voting round is required in Bogot√° based on specific percentages.
- Provide a menu-driven interface for easy data exploration.

**Key Points**:
- 7 Cities: Bogot√°, Barranquilla, Cali, Medell√≠n, Bucaramanga, Pasto, Cartagena.
- 3 Regions (Caribe, Centro, Sur) mapped to corresponding cities.
- 3 Political Parties.
- 4 Candidates per city.
- 3 Voting Sites per city; 4 tables per site.
- **Second Round Criteria**: A candidate wins in the first round with ‚â• 40% of votes plus a 10-point lead over the runner-up.

**Implementation**:
- Must be **modular** and follow best practices seen in class (e.g., well-named functions, code clarity).
- Outputs user-friendly messages and validated error handling.

## üß∞ Tech Stack

- **Python** as the primary language for all exercises and the final project.
- **Markdown** for documentation (e.g., this README).
- **Basic File I/O** handling for reading the voting data.
